Hedonic Pricing Methodology



Introduction to models where the outcome is home value: hedonic pricing models. 

The main insight is that home price is a variable that aggregates a tremendous amount of information about characteristics of houses, neighborhoods, and cities. We can use regression to separate out these difference attributes at different levels, and see they each contributes to the market value of a home. 

Since we are using the median home value variable which represents an entire census tract we focus on how neighborhood attributes and changes in attributes over time impact the average home price in the tract.
