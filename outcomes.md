## The Measurement Problem 

One fascinating aspect of neighborhood change programs is the ultimate goal is not always clear. 

It's relatively easy to define **distressed** communities. They tend to be characterized by: 

* High poverty rates 
* Low employment 
* Underperforming schools  
* Poor housing quality 
* Low social mobility for residents 

We need to be careful because not all "poor" communities are distressed communities. Chinatown in New York city has a high poverty rate because of the large proportion of first-generation immigrants that crowd into small apartments and work in some of the many low-paying industries active in the community. But it has dense social capital, affordable housing, opportunities for employment, and high rates of social mobility for children that grow up in the community. It is poor because it is a launching pad for poor immigrants, not because it is a poverty trap. 

*All distressed communities are poor communities, but not all poor communities are distressed.*

Community revitalization programs target distressed neighborhoods in an attempt to catalyze economic development. But what does this mean? 

**The Measurement Problem** in neighborhood change studies 

- wealth 
- displacement 
- people versus place 
- gentrification
