## The Measurement Problem 

One fascinating aspect of neighborhood change programs is the ultimate goal is not always clear. 

It's relatively easy to define **distressed** communities. They tend to be characterized by: 

* High poverty rates 
* Low employment 
* Underperforming schools  
* Poor housing quality 
* Low social mobility for residents 

We need to be careful because not all "poor" communities are distressed communities. Chinatown in New York city has a high poverty rate because of the large proportion of first-generation immigrants that crowd into small apartments and work in some of the many low-paying industries active in the community. But it has dense social capital, affordable housing, opportunities for employment, and high rates of social mobility for children that grow up in the community. It is poor because it is a launching pad for poor immigrants, not because it is a poverty trap. 

*All distressed communities are poor communities, but not all poor communities are distressed.*

Community revitalization programs target distressed neighborhoods in an attempt to catalyze economic development. But what does this mean? 

**The Measurement Problem** in neighborhood change studies 

- wealth 
- displacement 
- people versus place 
- gentrification

*We use data on intergenerational social mobility by neighborhood to examine how social and physical environments beyond concentrated poverty predict children’s long-term well-being. First, we examine neighborhoods that are harsh on children’s development: those characterized by high levels of violence, incarceration, and lead exposure….Our explanatory variables are constructed from the Community Survey of the PHDCN, which interviewed a representative sample of Chicago residents about their neighborhood social environments in 1995 and 2002 (combined N of ∼12,000); violent crime rates per 100,000 population from 1995 to 2000, derived from offenses reported by citizens to the police; incarceration rates per population from 1995 to 2000, derived from prison admission data; and lead exposure among children from 1995 to 1997, derived from more than 150,000 blood-level tests conducted by Chicago’s health department.*

Excerpt from NPR: “A Look At The Wealth And Income Gap, By ZIP Code”: 

*"The United States is still a land of opportunity for many. But when it comes to life outcomes, geography is too often destiny," says a report from the Economic Innovation Group, a research organization. Despite the economic recovery, the report says, life for those in the most distressed ZIP codes looks "much more like an ongoing downturn. Large swaths of the country are indeed being left behind by economic growth and change." The report calculates what it calls a "distressed community index" using seven metrics: housing vacancy rates, the number of adults working, the poverty rate, median income, the number of people with high school degrees, the change in employment and the rate of business formation.*
